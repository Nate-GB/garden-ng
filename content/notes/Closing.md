The primary purpose of the closing phase is to validate deliverables and document the formal acceptance of the project work. Once that's complete, a handoff occurs whereby the completed product or result of the project is turned over to the organization for ongoing maintenance and support. The closing phase includes validating deliverables, signing off on the project, archiving project documents, handing off the product to the organization, releasing project team members, and reviewing lessons learned. The key activities are as follows:

- Validating deliverables
- Closing contracts
- Removing access
- Releasing resources
- Holding the project closure meeting
- Writing the project closeout report
- Obtaining feedback and lesson learned
- Project sign-off
- Handing off the product to the organization
- Evaluating the project
- Archiving project documents
- Rewards and celebration
