A policy implemented to effectively communicate a security incident.  The goal is to communicate to necessary parties **only**, to avoid alerting attackers as well. This can be achieved through a [Call List](notes/Call%20List.md), as well as policy for communication means, such as voice or text messaging, or other messaging systems with end-to-end encryption such as OTR, Signal, or WhatsApp.
