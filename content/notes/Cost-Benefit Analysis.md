Compares the cost to produce the product or service to the financial gain (or benefit) the organization stands to make as a result of executing the project.  

Includes development costs, marketing costs, technology costs, and ongoing support costs (if applicable) when calculating total cost

A good choice of Financial Analysis if the project selection decision is based on how quickly the project investment will be recouped from either decreased expenses or increased revenue

The weakness of this model is that it does not account for other important factors, such as strategic  value.
