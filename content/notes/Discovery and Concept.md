The first phase in the [Project Life Cycle](notes/Project%20Life%20Cycle.md). This phase determines whether the project is worthwhile.  A [Business Case](notes/Business%20Case.md) is created to document the business need or justification for the project and will often include high0level details about estimated budgets and timelines for completing the project.

The discovery phase also examines several elements that could help speed up the execution of the project, like working with prequalified vendors or predetermined clients.
