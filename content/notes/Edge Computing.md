Edge computing is devolved from [[Fog Computing]] and uses the following concepts:
- Edge devices collect and depend upon data for their operation, like a thermometer in an HVAC system collects temperature data which in turn is used by the HVAC system to turn the heating or air conditioning on or off.  Latency is VERY important
- Edge gateways perform some pre-processing of data to and from edge devices for prioritization. 
- Fog nodes can be incorporated as a data processing layer
- the cloud of data center layer provides the main storage and processing resources, plus distribution and aggregation of data between sites
