A study undertaken before the [Business Case](notes/Business%20Case.md) is written. Can determine whether the project is doable and likely to success. Examines the viability of the product, service, or result of the project. May also examine technical issues related to the project and determine whether it's feasible, reliable, and easily assimilated into the organization's existing infrastructure. Not every business case needs a feasibility study.
