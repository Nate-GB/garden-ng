Makes it a crime to bribe a foreign official, a foreign political part official, or a candidate for foreign political office. The act applies to any US citizen or company and to any company with shares listed on any US stock exchange. However, a bribe is not a crime if the payment was lawful under the laws of the foreign country in which it was paid.
