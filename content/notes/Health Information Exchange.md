The process of sharing patient-level electronic health information between different organizations. The key to electronic exchange is the standardization of health data. Once standardized, the data can be transmitted electronically to specialist, hospitals, labs, imaging facilities, emergency rooms, and pharmacies, with subsets of the data shared with insurance companies, government agencies, patients, and employers.
