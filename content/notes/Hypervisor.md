A hypervisor is the system that allows [Virtual Machines](notes/Virtual%20Machines.md) to be run.  There are 2 types of hypervisor: Type 1 and Type 2. 

## Type 1
Type 1 hypervisors are often referred to as "bare metal." They are installed directly onto the hardware of a machine. And example of this would be Microsoft's Hyper-V.

## Type 2
Type 2 hypervisors are installed on top of an OS. An example of this would be Oracle's VirtualBox.
