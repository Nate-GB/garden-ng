# Incident Response Plan

- Lists the procedures, contacts, and resources available to responders for various incident categories
- [CIRT](notes/CIRT.md) responsible for developing profiles or scenarios of typical incidents (DDoS, virus/worm outbreak, data exfiltration by an external adversary, etc)
	- These profiles guide investigators in determining priorities and remediation plans
- [[CIRT]] could also be responsible for making a [[Playbook]]

## Assess for Severity

- Each incident has to be assessed and prioritized to allocate resources efficiently. There are several factors that can affect this process:
	- Data Integrity
		- See also: [CIA Triad](notes/CIA%20Triad.md)
	- Downtime
	- Economic/publicity
	- Scope
	- Detection time
	- Recovery Time
