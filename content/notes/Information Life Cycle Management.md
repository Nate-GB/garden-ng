# The information life cycle model
- Creation/collection
	- data may be generated by an employee or automated system, or it may be submitted by a customer or supplier. Data *must* be classified and tagged
- Distribution/Use
	- data is made available on a need to know basis for authorized uses by authenticated account holders and third parties
- Retention
	- for regulatory reasons, data might have to be kept in an archive past the date when it is still used
- Disposal
	- when it no longer needs to be used or retained, media storing data assets must be sanitized to remove any remnants
