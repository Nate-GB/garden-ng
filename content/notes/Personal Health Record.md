Includes the portions of the [Electronic Health Record](notes/Electronic%20Health%20Record.md) that are routinely shared with the patient, such as personal identifiers, contact information, health provider information, problem list, medication history, allergies, immunizations, and lab and test results.

Can exist either as a stand-alone application that allows information to be exported to or imported from other sources or as a "tethered" application connected to a specific healthcare organization's information system. Tethered PHRs are called "Patient Portals"
