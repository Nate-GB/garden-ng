In the planning phase, the project goals, objectives, and deliverables are refined and broken down into manageable units of work. Project managers create time and cost estimates and determine resource requirements for each activity. Planning involves several other critical areas of project management, such as communication, risk, human resources, quality, and procurement. Some of the key activities in the Planning process group are as follows:

- Develop a detailed project scope statement

- Assess and assign project resources
- Perform an initial risk assessment
