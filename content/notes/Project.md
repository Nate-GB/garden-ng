A project can be anything as long as it fits the following criteria:

1. A project must be _Unique_. Every project involves doing something new, which means the end result should be a unique product or service
2. **Temporary**: Projects must have defined start and end dates. They can be far apart, like years, or short, like a few weeks, but each project must have a start and end date
3. **Reason or Purpose**: A project comes about to fulfill a purpose.  The might include introducing a new product, fulfilling a business objective or strategic goal, satisfying a social need, and any number of other reasons.  It's important to document and communicate the purpose and reasons for the project so that the team members remain focused on achieving the goals of the project.
4. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: A project starts once it's been identified, the objectives have been outlined in the project charter, and appropriate stakeholders have approved the project plan. A project ends when those goals have been met to the satisfaction of the stakeholders
