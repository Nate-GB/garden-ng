Risk transference is the idea that utilizing cloud computing allows a company to transfer some degree of risk to another party.  It doesn't transfer all risk in most cases, and is something that must be decided on as part of the [[notes/Service Level Agreement]].  Risk transference heavily depends on what cloud service type you opt to use.
