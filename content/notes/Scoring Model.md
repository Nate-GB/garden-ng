A scoring model has a predefined list of criteria against which each alternative solution or project is rated. Each criterion is given both a scoring range and a weighting factor. The weighting factor accounts for the difference in importance of the various criteria.

Scoring models can include financial data as well as items such as market value, organizational expertise to complete the project, innovation, and fit with corporate culture.  

A combination of objective and subjective criteria. The final rating of each solution is calculated using the rating and weighting factor of each criterion. 

A benefit of this model is that you can place a heavier weight on a criterion that is of more importance. The weakness is that the ranking it produces is only as valuable as the criteria and weighting system the ranking is based on.
