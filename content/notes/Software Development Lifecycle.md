There are 4 main phases to the software development lifecycle:
1. Analysis
	1. This is the practice of determining the goals for a program
	2. The "Why"
2. Design
	1. Design determines the specifics of how to build a program
	2. The "What"
3. Implementation
	1. Implementation builds the program according to the design
	2. The "How"
4. Testing
	1. Testing checks that the program meets the goal

There are 2 main methods of implementing the software development lifecycle: the [[notes/Waterfall Approach]] and the [[notes/Agile Approach]].

Agile involves continuous development, testing, and integration and is by far the more flexible of the two.  It revolves around implementing deliverables piece-by-piece rather than all at once.  In contrast, the Waterfall Approach delivers the entire project at once, but suffers from lack of customer feedback and longer overall deliverable timelines.
