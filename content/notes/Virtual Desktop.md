Virtual desktops are essentially hosted VMs that a client connects to for OS access. The clients are typically not very resource-equipped and are referred to as "thin clients." A thin client would connect to a server or provider, which then hosts the [Virtual Machines](notes/Virtual%20Machines.md) and streams the data back to the thin client over the network.  The virtual machines are hosted by the server's [Hypervisor](notes/Hypervisor.md) and uses the server's resources to handle all the necessary processing, memory, and storage.
