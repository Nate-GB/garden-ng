AKA Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, this act regulates the interception of wire and oral communications. It allows state and federal law enforcement officials to use wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, but only under strict limitations. Law enforcement MUST acquire a warrant, which may only be awarded if there is probably cause and that normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed.
